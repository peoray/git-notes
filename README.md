#### To delete a local branch:
**N.B:You cannot delete the branch you are currently on.** 

If you are in the same branch that you want to delete, run:

`git checkout <another-branch>` to switch to another branch(because you can't delete a branch you are currently on)

Then delete the branch you want:

`git branch -d <branch-name>`

---

#### To delete a remote branch:

`git push --delete <remote_name> <branch_name>`

---
#### To remove remote origin from Git repo:
Instead of removing and re-adding, you can do this:

`git remote set-url <origin> git://<new.url.here>`

If you insist on deleting it:

`git remote rm <origin>`

To add another remote:

`git remote add <origin> <yourRemoteUrl>`

---

#### To update a GitHub forked repository:

Add the remote, call it "upstream":

`git remote add <upstream> https://github.com/<whoever>/<whatever.git>`

Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches, such as upstream/master:

`git fetch <upstream>`

Make sure that you're on your master branch(or the main branch):

`git checkout master`

Updating your fork from original repo to keep up with their changes:

`git merge upstream/master`

See [here](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Syncing-your-fork-to-the-original-repository-via-the-browser) on how to update your forked repo via the browser.

#### How to untrack a file by git

To remove a file or folde already tracked by git, then you must first remove it (physically, file or folder must be placed out of git folder for the time), commit changes and add the file again to folder. Then git will begin ignoring it using your instruction. 

`git rm --cached <name of file/folder>`

`git add .`

---

#### To delete a git folder from your project:
`rm -rf .git`

This command will remove `.git` file from the directory. 

To confirm: 

`git status`

This will give a command of `fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`

---

#### To change a remote URL

List your existing remote:

`git remote -v`

Then to change the existing to a new one:

`git remote set-url origin [URL]`

To confirm:

`git remote -v`
